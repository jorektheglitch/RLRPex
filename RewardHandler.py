@package RewardHandler
Created on Aug 6, 2016

@author: Dmitrii Dugaev


This module is responsible for a reward distribution between the nodes. It means both reception and transmission of
the generated reward values, depending on current state of RouteTable entries towards a given destination L3 address.
There are two main behaviors here.

The first is RewardWaitHandler - which is waiting for the reward from the neighbor where the packet had been
sent to earlier. If the reward wasn't received within a defined timeout interval - the handler assumes that
the packet has been lost, therefore, it triggers a negative reward value for the corresponding RouteTable entry.

The second is RewardSendHandler - it generates and sends back the reward to a source node after waiting for some
"hold on" time interval, which is needed to control a number of generated reward messages for some number of
the received packets with the same dst_ip address.
